# Archived Test Planning Documents

**Status**: Historical - Tests Implemented
**Date Archived**: 2025-11-14

## Purpose of This Archive

These documents were used during the test implementation planning phase (Phase 0-1).
Now that all tests are implemented and working (118/123 passing), these detailed
plans are preserved for historical reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Archived Files

1. **TEST_PLAN.md** - Main test plan index
2. **TEST_PLAN_BASE_FUNCTIONALITY.md** - Core feature tests
3. **TEST_PLAN_MCP_TOOLS.md** - MCP tool tests
4. **TEST_PLAN_COMPILE_COMMANDS.md** - Compile commands tests
5. **TEST_PLAN_ADVANCED_FEATURES.md** - Advanced feature tests
6. **TEST_PLAN_STATISTICS.md** - Statistics and metrics tests
7. **TEST_PLAN_INTEGRATION.md** - Integration tests
8. **TEST_PLAN_SECURITY_ROBUSTNESS.md** - Security and robustness tests

**Total**: ~4,500 lines of detailed test specifications

## What to Use Instead

For current test information, use:

- **TEST_COVERAGE.md** - Test coverage summary and quick reference
- **TESTING.md** - How to run tests
- **Actual test files** in `tests/` directory - The source of truth

---

## Why Archived?

1. ✅ All tests are now implemented as actual Python code
2. ✅ Test suite is passing (95.9% pass rate)
3. ✅ Actual test code is more accurate than planning documents
4. ✅ Reduced maintenance burden (no need to update 2 places)

## When to Refer to These

- Understanding the original test design rationale
- Historical context for why certain tests were created
- Template for planning future test expansions
- Learning how comprehensive test planning was done
